                <p>I grew up in rural Wisconsin on a small dairy farm. Growing up on a farm taught me a lot of things: the value of hard work, the circle of life, and most importantly, I could solve any problem I put my mind to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While growing up in the countryside had many perks, I knew I wanted to venture out and explore. 
                    I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Stout with a BFA in Interior Design which combined my love for problem solving, 
                    mathematics & building with my creative/designing talents. After graduation, I made the bold decision to move to one of the most cultured, historic, 
                    and unique cities in the world. I've lived on the bayou in the heart of New Orleans for the past 7 years with my dog Henri. 
                    Up until recently I've been an Interior Designer for the largest and most established firms in the city, <a style="color:#f0f2f0"href="http://www.eskewdumezripple.com"> EskewDumezRipple</a>. You can check out some of my work at my <a style="color:#f0f2f0"href="http://www.ashleyswiggum.com">Portfolio</a>. 
                    But I've given it all up to pursue my passion & to reinvent myself as a badass Programmer!

                <h1 id="journey">My Journey</h1>
                    <p> My journey into coding/programming has been an interesting one as I'm sure many can relate to. My passion towards problem solving and building originally led me into a career of Interior Design. 
                        Being an ID I could work directly with Architects to design the built environment and see how humans and the environment interact with it. However, I found myself more enthralled with the technologies 
                        we used to build more efficiently and sustainbly. I started thinking about how these technologies & softwares were designed and built and how they could be improved. Then the pandemic hit and made me realize 
                        (like most people) how fragile some industries are. That's when I started thinking more seriously about a career as a Software Engineer and how I could merge my passion for sustainability, problem solving, and 
                        designing/building into the world of tech.

                <p>Being from the country, I've always been very outdoorsy.
                     Whenever the weather is nice you can catch me either kayaking on the bayou, hiking, biking, or camping out in the woods. Honestly, I'm always up for an outdoor adventure of any sorts.
                    I also love traveling/exploring and am a bit of an adrenaline junkie whose goal is to go skydiving every year for my birthday in different parts of the country/world.
